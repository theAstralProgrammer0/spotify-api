## Spotify API with Customizable Colors (Vercel)

This project provides a simple API endpoint that allows you to customize the background and border colors for a Spotify integration (or any other use case you prefer).

### Features

  * Accepts query parameters for background color (`background_color`) and border color (`border_color`).
  * Returns a JSON response with the received parameters and their formatted hex codes.
  * Designed for deployment on Vercel as a serverless function.

### Deployment

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js and a Vercel account.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in the project directory.
4.  **Deploy to Vercel:** Connect your Git repository to Vercel and deploy the project.
5.  **Access the API:** After deployment, Vercel will provide a URL for your project. The API endpoint can be accessed using the following format:

<!-- end list -->

```
https://your-vercel-app-name.vercel.app/api/spotify?background_color=1a1b27&border_color=DD2BC7
```

**Replace `your-vercel-app-name` with the actual name of your Vercel deployment.**

**Example Usage:**

```
https://your-vercel-app-name.vercel.app/api/spotify?background_color=FF0000&border_color=0000FF  (Red background, blue border)
```

### How it Works

This project utilizes a serverless function written in Node.js. The function retrieves the query parameters (`background_color` and `border_color`) from the URL and provides default values if they are not present. It then returns a JSON response containing the received parameters and their formatted hex codes.
